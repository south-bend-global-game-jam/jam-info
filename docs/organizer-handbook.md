# Jam Organizer Handbook

Here are some guidelines to follow during the jam in order to help participants enjoy the event.



----- ----- -----

## Encourage participants to engage on Discord 

### General behavior

Emphasize use and purpose of general and attendees chats, sharing, and help channels

Organizers should promote chatter in these channels by initiating and engaging in conversation.


### Sharing Channel: #showoff-progress
This is a dedicated Discord channel for showing off progress

Encourage participants to post, eg. “Made a cool looking char? Post it.”

You can drag and drop most file types or links in Discord

Organizers be active in this channel to promote participant use


### Help Channel: #help
This channel is for both practical help, eg. "How do I submit my game?" and for gamedev help, eg. "How do I add sound effects?"

This is the most important channel for us to watch. Consider turning on notifications.

Don't leave people hanging. If you don't have an answer, try to connect them with someone might.

Engage directly. If the problem is longer to answer than a few sentences, ask to take the conversation to their group text or voice chat.

## Converse at dedicated mealtimes and group activities

### Mealtime hangout prompts
- “What are you having for breakfast/lunch/dinner?”
- “What would you rather be eating?”

### Group sharing prompts
- What is your game about in 2 sentences?
- What is something you're particularly proud of so far? (Share it in the #showoff-progress channel too)
- Is there anything you are stuck on or want help with?

## Reach out to participants

Organizers should reach out to groups regularly. Coordinate with the other organizers so that teams feel attended but not bombarded.

First, message in group text channels to avoid intruding

Ask to hang out in group voice chanel for 5 min.


### If the group seems more seem more relaxed

Lead with asking what they’re making


### If the group seems more stressed or rushed

Lead with asking if there’s any help we can give


### Offering help
Be direct when giving help. Sending people to our help channel doesn’t feel good; instead try to connect them with someone who knows an answer.


### Encourage the group

Be honest, but positive and engaging

Wouldn't you rather engage with a question than with a statement?

#### Encouragement prompts
- “This looks/plays/sounds awesome!”
- “I’m excited to see more!”
- “What do you have planned?”
- “What happens when X?
- “I can tell you worked hard on this, great job!”
- “Wow! How did you do/think of that?”
- “How are you using the theme? / That’s a cool way of using the theme!”
